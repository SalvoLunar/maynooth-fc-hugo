Mick was a man of standing and character, somebody who made a difference in his community through his contribution to football and music.

He was proud of his family, his community and his club. He was a stalwart figure in the development and transition of our club to the where it is today.

Mick was at the heart of our club, he lived and breathed Maynooth Town, from the early days looking after schoolboys to seniors, as Chairman and latterly as our beloved President.

He enjoyed the fun and the banter but he was also a man of serious intent. He understood how a club rooted in the community had to adapt and change bringing new people, skills and ideas to bear but always maintaining the values of community and representing the Town. He would put you right if you strayed from the path.

He took great pride in our growth as a club and in the development of our grounds at Rathcoffey Road, where he loved to look out on our field of dreams.

It was lovely to have him, the father figure of our club, present at the Aviva Stadium in 2018 for that moment in history when the Town took the FAI Intermediate Cup.

To Josephine and family we offer our sincere sympathies.

We thank you for sharing him with us.

C’mon the Town
