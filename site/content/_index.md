welcome: MTFC COVID-19 Update | 08.08.20
blurb: >-
  We have considered the exemption regarding training and have decided to
  suspend all organised training activities for the next two weeks in the
  interest of everyoneâ€™s safety. This is in line with the FAI announcement that
  all football activity in Kildare is to be suspended. Our grounds at Rathcoffey
  Road are now closed for all walking, jogging and football activity. We will
  update further as the situation evolves. Stay safe.
