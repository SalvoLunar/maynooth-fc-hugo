      Maynooth Town F.C. was founded in 1969 when two local teams, St. Mary's
      and Ballygoran, merged together to create MTFC. After tentative beginnings
      with just one team, we've slowly but surely grown to 35 teams after 50
      years! 


      One of our biggest highlights from over the years was when our LSL Senior
      Sunday Squad – Maynooth University Town – made a remarkable comeback to
      win the FAI Intermediate Cup 4-1 in extra time versus Firhouse Clover in
      2018!
