      Maynooth Town FC was founded in 1969, arising from the merger of two local
      clubs â€“ Maynooth St. Mary's and Ballygoran Utd. Legend has it the
      formation meeting took place at Feeney's Milkstand on the Celbridge Road.

      From tentative beginnings, a 50-year journey unfolded. We've enjoyed
      significant success in the Leinster Counties League and the Sheeran Cup,
      and won the Polikoff Junior Cup in 2014. 


      While our seniors, Maynooth University Town, brought us all the way to the
      FAI Intermediate Cup Final in the Aviva Stadium in 2018, defeating
      Firhouse Clover 4-1 in extra time for a historic victory after a
      remarkable comeback. 


      With over 35 teams including, schoolboys and schoolgirls in the NDSL and
      MGL leagues, KDSL over 35's, and our seniors Maynooth University Town (a
      collaboration of club and university, competing at the highest level in
      the Leinster Senior League), the club's journey continues.
