      Maynooth Town F.C was founded in 1969 when two local teams, St. Mary's and
      Ballygoran, merged together to create MTFC. We began with 1 team and
      slowly but surely grew to 35 teams after 50 years!


      One of our biggest highlights from over the years was when our LSL Senior
      Sunday Squad - Maynooth University Town - made a remarkable comeback to
      win the FAI Intermediate Cup 4-1 in extra time versus Firhouse Clover in
      2018!
