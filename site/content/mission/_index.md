      Maynooth Town FC is a community club that supports the opportunity for all
      young players in our community to participate in, develop their skills and
      enjoy soccer at a level appropriate to their ability.


      The Club have drawn up a Code of Principles & Best Practice document to
      outline what we regard as best practice for our club. We invite everyone
      to become familiar with these principles.


      If your son or daughter is interested in playing soccer, please contact
      the Club Secretary, Miriam Murphy, on 086-1060654 or by email:
      miriammtfc@outlook.com
